# Question: Get the positions where elements of a and b match

# Input: a = np.array([1,2,3,2,3,4,3,4,5,6])
#        b = np.array([7,2,10,2,7,4,9,4,9,8])

# Output: (array([1, 3, 5, 7]),)


# Solution
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1,2,3,2,3,4,3,4,5,6])
b = np.array([7,2,10,2,7,4,9,4,9,8])
out = np.where(b==a)
print(out)
